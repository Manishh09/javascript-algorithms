## 🚀 Introduction

This repository contains notes, examples, and implementations for learning fundamental algorithms and data structures in JavaScript. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews or strengthening your computer science fundamentals, this guide will help you understand core concepts with practical JavaScript examples.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

Understanding how to evaluate and measure algorithm efficiency:

- **Algorithm Evaluation** - Methods for comparing different algorithms
- **Asymptotic Notation** - Mathematical notation for describing algorithm behavior
- **Time Complexity** - How execution time grows with input size
- **Space Complexity** - How memory usage scales with input

📁 Location: [`02-time-and-complexity/`](./02-time-and-complexity/)

## 📊 Big O Notation

Learn to analyze algorithm performance using Big O notation:

- Understanding Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega
- Analyzing nested loops and their complexity
- Practical examples with algorithms like sum of natural numbers

📁 Location: [`03-big-O-notation/`](./03-big-O-notation/)

### Examples Included

- `nested-loops.js` - Complexity analysis of nested iterations
- `sum-of-natural-numbers.js` - Multiple approaches to solving the same problem

## 🗂️ Objects and Arrays

Deep dive into JavaScript's fundamental data structures:

- Array operations and their time complexities
- Object manipulation and performance characteristics
- Built-in methods and their efficiency

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to any topic folder and explore the examples:

   ```bash
   cd 03-big-O-notation
   node sum-of-natural-numbers.js
   ```

3. Read the markdown files for theoretical concepts and run JavaScript files to see implementations in action.

## 📝 Learning Path

1. Start with [`01-intro/intro.md`](./01-intro/intro.md) to understand the fundamentals
2. Move to time and space complexity to learn how to evaluate algorithms
3. Master Big O notation for analyzing algorithm efficiency
4. Practice with objects and arrays - the building blocks of data structures
