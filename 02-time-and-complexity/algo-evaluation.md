# Algorithm Analysis

- if you a problem, we can solve it in multiple ways

- E.g sorting of list elements

So how can we analyze which is most efficient among those ?

> The absolutte running of an algorithm cannot be predicted, since it depends on a number of factors  like below:

- OS
- Progr language in which its runing
- Mutiple programms on running at same time

---

So how do we evaluate an algorithm ?THE INPUT SIZE
