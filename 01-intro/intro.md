# Algorithms

- An algorithm in general is like a set of instructions defined to solve a particular problem

## Characteristics

- input, outputs should be defined

- each step must be clear

- language agnostistic

---

## Why ?

- Provides different ways of efficiently solve a problem

- Since one poblem can be solved in several ways using different algorithms
